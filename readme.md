Implementation of a fantasy congress game.  Hoping to run one "semi-automatic"
league for the 2014 session of congress.  Stats will be calculated by a script
run manually, transactions will all take place offline and be recorded in flat
text files.

Currently, we're just gathering stats from the 2013 session of congress to aid
in devising a scoring system.
